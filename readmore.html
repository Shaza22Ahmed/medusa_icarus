        Pitched by Linke and Yee in around 2014-2015, everything from planning and starting up the project to the overall writing, production, and animation took around six years before its eventual release.[7][8][9][10] With this being the company's first foray into this media format, Riot Games decided to have Arcane developed internally and independently financed,[11] though initially through the collaboration of Linke and Yee with artists they've worked with before they began to receive more funding from Riot.[9]

        Riot's then Global Head of Entertainment Businesses and Partnerships Jarred Kennedy worked with a creative team of writers (including Linke and Yee) in Los Angeles. The series was produced with and animated by Fortiche Productions, a French animation and creative production studio based in Paris that has worked with Riot on various videos for its champions in the past.[11] The voice actors came in early in the production process,[8][12] but majority of the main cast was only announced years later on September 21st, 2021.[13][14]

        The series was announced on October 15th, 2019 as part of the League of Legends 10th anniversary celebrations,[11][15] with Riot Games' CEO Nicolo Laurent stating that they have plans for Arcane to have multiple seasons.[16] Original slated for a 2020 release,[11] the show was delayed to 2021 due to COVID-19-related difficulties.[17] On May 3rd, 2021, it was announced that the show has been picked up by Netflix for international release and by Tencent Video in China with a fall release date.[18][19] On September 25th, 2021, the release date for the first 3 episodes was revealed to be November 6th, 2021.[20]

        Though the events of the series are heavily based on the established lore of the game, some differences have already been noted in the series. Creators Christian Linke and Alex Lee have shared that the changes are not necessarily retcons but are "adjustments in order to give [the viewers] the best story possible". Though working to make Arcane as consistent as possible with canon, as of 2021, he doesn't "think [they] would be considered a source of truth over the game", adding that they are taking into consideration the reaction of the fans, the current setup of Riot and its games, as well as the updates and changes to the characters.[21]

        On January 29th, 2022, Thomas 'Wikingham' Cunningham, Senior Manager of Narrative Editing for League of Legends, would state in an interview with Polygon that "Their stories and their designs in Arcane are intentionally different from the Jayce and Viktor you see in-game, specifically to fit the show. So, it’s unlikely that we will make major changes to League of Legends’ Jayce and Viktor to match 1:1 with Arcane’s," when asked if any of these changes will eventually be consolidated into the game’s canon at large. Based on his response at the time, Arcane 2021 profileicon Arcane and Runeterra Map profileicon League of Legends were separate entities, with the former drawing heavy influences from the latter, but ultimately deviating to better support the show.[22]

        On February 16th 2023, Andrei 'Meddler' van Roon, the Head of League Studio, stated that Riot was going to be more "thoughtful" and "deliberate" about making a "consistent and cohesive wider Runeterran experience", in reference to the lore of League of Legends being inconsistent across different mediums.[23] When asked how this approach to narrative cohesiveness would affect Arcane, he noted that Riot wants to "get to a state where Arcane, LoL, LoR etc are all clearly building in the same canon".[24] On October 12th, 2023, Laura 'poisonpixxi' DeYoung, Head of IP Creative for Riot Games, elaborated on their new approach to narrative cohesiveness by explaining that there would be one shared canon moving forward and confirmed that Arcane was part of that canon.[25][26] Andrei van Roon would also note that the origin of hextech in Arcane would be the new origin going forward and champions related to it would be adjusted to match.</p>

        Following the season's conclusion on November 20th, 2021, Riot Games and Netflix announced that a second season was in production.[27][28][29] On November 9th, 2023, Netflix announced that season 2 would premiere in November 2024 at Geeked Week 2023.[30] On November 12th, 2023, series co-creator Christian 'Praeco' Linke noted that a "song that everyone on the team absolutely LOVES for a particular scene" created by a "(very big) artist" was in production for the second season, however, because Riot cannot guarantee a marketing campaign that would elevate it above the other songs in the soundtrack, the record label would likely not allow them to use it.[31]</p>
